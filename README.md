Written in Kotlin

Import and run the application using IntelliJ IDEA

Sample request to store a blog:
```javascript
POST localhost:8080/blogs
{
    "id": 1,
    "author": "jeo",
    "date": "11/13/87",
    "content": "content",
    "title": "title"
}
```

Sample request to retrieve a blog:
```javascript
GET localhost:8080/blogs/1
```

Note: I made the application to be simple so that it completes the requested tasks and nothing more
